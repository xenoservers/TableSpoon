***
**PLEASE NOTE: We do NOT provide any support for branches, forks, or unofficial versions of TableSpoon nor do we support any unofficial or beta releases of PocketMine. We are NOT responsible for any damages or corruptions that may occur by using this plugin. You assume ALL responsibility and accept the risks by using this plugin.**


TableSpoon is not yet complete which means it **ships with many unknown issues and bugs** that you should be aware of before attempting to use certain features. Do not expect anything to "just work" as nothing is guaranteed at this point in development (extremely alpha stage, duh). By using our releases, you acknowledge that there may be non-commercialized/production features not implemented, misbehaving, or simply broken. **This is normal**, we will announce in version releases what has been updated, fixed, or added at the time of upload.


If there's a config option disabled by default, it probably means it doesn't work properly. Please don't report bugs that only apply to you or are caused because of other plugin interference at this time.
